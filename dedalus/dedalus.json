Use \u201cRaise Hand\u201d or chat to request unmute.\n- Check your input device:\n  - Click the arrow next to the mic icon > Select the correct microphone > Test mic.\n  - Make sure your headset\u2019s inline mute switch (if any) is off.\n- Check OS/app permissions:\n  - Windows: Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone > Allow apps to access the microphone > Ensure Zoom is allowed.\n  - Mac: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone > Enable Zoom.\n  - iOS: Settings > Zoom > Microphone > On.\n  - Android: Settings > Apps > Zoom > Permissions > Microphone > Allow.\n- If using the web client:\n  - Allow microphone access in the browser (click the padlock/camera icon near the address bar and allow mic access), then refresh.\n\nAudio troubleshooting in Zoom:\n- Zoom app > Settings > Audio > Test Mic and Speaker. Speak and check the input level.\n- Disable other apps that may be using the mic (Teams, Discord, DAWs) and close extra audio devices.\n- Restart Zoom or your computer if the mic isn\u2019t detected.\n\nTip: The red slash only indicates Zoom mute; your mic could also be muted at the system or device level. Ensure both are unmuted.",
